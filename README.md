Two projects
The first one was related to used car price prediction along with dataset and code
and the second one was related to cancer prediction
Project #1
Used Car Selling Price Prediction

I have used a linear regression model to predict the prices of used cars.
The dataset contains information about used cars. Data can be used for a lot of
purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in
Machine Learning. The columns in the given dataset are as follows: 1. Name 2. Year
3. Selling price 4. Present price 5. Km_driven 6. Fuel 7. Seller type 8. Transmission 9.

Project #2
Cancer Prediction
Cancer Predictions by examining the expressions of proteins. These protein
expressions helped to identify specific types of cancer. The dataset Mice protein
expressions and a Neural Network model were used for this task.
