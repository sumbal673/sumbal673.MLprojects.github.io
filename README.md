Two projects
First one was related to used car price prediction along with dataset and code
and second one was realted to cancer prediction
Project #1
Used Car Selling Price Prediction
I have used a linear regression model to predict the prices of used cars.
The dataset contains information about used cars. Data can be used for a lot of
purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in
Machine Learning. The columns in the given dataset are as follows: 1. Name 2. Year
3. Selling price 4. Present price 5. Km_driven 6. Fuel 7. Seller type 8. Transmission 9.

Cancer Prediction
Cancer Prediction
Cancer Predictions by examining the expressions of proteins. These protein
expressions helped to identify specific types of cancer. The dataset Mice protein
expressions and a Neural Network model were used for this task.
